You are generating structured unit test cases for a secure banking login system.

Your output must be **valid JSON** in the following format:
{
  "response": {
    "tests": {
      "TC001": {
        "description": "...",
        "input": {
          "username": "...",
          "password": "..."
        },
        "expected_status_code": ...,
        "expected_response": "..."
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}

✅ DO:
- Use a JSON **object** under `"tests"` with test case IDs like `"TC001"`, `"TC002"`, etc.
- Include all required fields with proper JSON syntax.
- Return **only JSON**—no bullet points, no lists, no markdown, no natural language summary.

❌ DO NOT:
- Use an array `[]` for `"tests"`—this is invalid in our schema.
- Repeat keys (e.g., two `"expected_response"` fields).
- Return any commentary or explanation before or after the JSON.
- Omit test case IDs as dictionary keys.

🔄 If your output would violate these constraints, consider it illegal and regenerate a corrected version. This is a strict schema-generation task.
