Your output must be **valid JSON** in the following format:

    "tests": {
      "TC001": {

        "expected_response": "..."
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}

‚úÖ DO:
- Use a JSON **object** under `"tests"` with test case IDs like `"TC001"`, `"TC002"`, etc.
- Include all required fields with proper JSON syntax.
- Return **only JSON**‚Äîno bullet points, no lists, no markdown, no natural language summary.

‚ùå DO NOT:
- Use an array `[]` for `"tests"`‚Äîthis is invalid in our schema.
- Repeat keys (e.g., two `"expected_response"` fields).
- Return any commentary or explanation before or after the JSON.
- Omit test case IDs as dictionary keys.

üîÑ If your output would violate these constraints, consider it illegal and regenerate a corrected version. This is a strict schema-generation task.

Think very broadly about the functionality of the prompt. Logically include every test cases that can be assumed and figure about it's content required from the above prompt.
